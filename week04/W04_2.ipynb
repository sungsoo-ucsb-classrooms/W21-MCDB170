    "If you join a lab or a biotech company, you may well have to deal with many biological sequences. However, using the string type in Python to represent sequences would be quite cumbersome, because it does not provide tools specific to biological sequence analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many biologists who have experienced the same problem and they have shared their own modules and packages. Eventually, people began to collect the most commonly used tools into a coherent package, Biopython. It provides tools useful for many biological analyses, not just sequence analysis, but also 3D protein structure analysis and statistical analysis specific to biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this and the next lectures, we are entering into the territory of real scientific programming. I will show you, as a showcase, how to use Biopython to manipulate biological sequences. You will see a number of classes and functions in these lectures.  Note that **you do not have to memorize them**. Unlike basic Python data structures, such as Lists or Dictionaries that are universally used across the entire Python community, these classes are specific to biological sequence analysis. Even seasoned scientists may not memorize all those functions except those they most frequently use. They constantly google to find useful functions and copy & paste code snippets. Therefore, **it is important to know which functions 'exist' or at least where you can find them**. The chance is that unless you're solving a completely new problem, there is a solution on the internet. Finally, it is very important to **test every single code you copy & paste before using it** in any serious program. A small grammatical error during copy & paste may generate un-recognizable errors. Thus, whenever you use other people's code, test it in a short program and deploy it after you confirmed working.\n",

We know that there are useful functions in these classes to easily manipulate the information (you don't have to remember them, but it is good to know what kind of functions are available and where to find how to use them).\n",
